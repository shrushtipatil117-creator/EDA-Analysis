# EDA-Analysis
Comprehensive EDA using Python,states,and visualizations on Titanic Dataset
 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Task 2
### 📌 Project Overview
This project performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* using Python to understand data patterns, relationships, and insights through statistics and visualization.

The analysis is implemented using *Google Colab*.

The main goal of this project is to:

* Understand dataset structure
* Perform statistical analysis
* Visualize data distributions
* Identify trends, correlations, and anomalies

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

### 📊 EDA Steps Performed

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Summary statistics generation (mean, median, std, etc.)
4. Histogram and boxplot visualization
5. Correlation analysis using heatmap
6. Pattern and trend identification
7. Basic insights from visual analysis

### 📈 Visualizations Included

* Histograms for numerical features
* Boxplots for outlier detection
* Correlation matrix
* Feature relationship plots

### ✅ Key Insights

* Certain features show strong correlation.
* Some columns contain outliers.
* Data distribution is skewed for specific variables.
* Missing values affected analysis in some features.

### ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook in *Google Colab*.
2. Upload the dataset if required.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
4. Observe outputs and visualizations.
